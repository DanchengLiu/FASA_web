there were two animals an elephant and a giraffe  who wanted to play in a pool 
and     they were playing with a ball 
and it fell into the pool 
and they wanted to    swim and get it 
and they thought it was fun 
one of them   he went into the water and tried to swim to the ball 
but the ball was floating away from him 
  and   then the giraffe  got the ball for the elephant 
and then  the elephant   started playing with the ball again 
   and they still wanted to play with it 
so  they still played together 
the end  
there was a no running sign 
and they still wanted to play in the pool 
and   they were running  away 
  and then    the giraffe started chasing the elephant 
and the elephant slipped 
and then it hurt  itself 
and the elephant was crying 
and the giraffe  said are you okay 
and then the  lifeguard came  and said are youall right 
 and the elephant  got a bandaid and sat on the chair 
  and    the elephant was trying to get off  the bandaid 
and the lifeguard   said keep it on 
the end  
the giraffe and the elephant came back to the pool with the airplane 
the giraffe was playing with it and tried not to drop it into the pool 
and the elephant was  so into it 
  the elephant     kept staring at it 
  the giraffe said hey  when the elephant took the plane away 
and the elephant started playing with it 
and the elephant accidentally dropped it into the pool 
and the giraffe was kind of  mad 
and then  he was so  mad that he growled at the elephant 
and the elephant was    scared 
  and the elephant called the lifeguard to come and try to get the airplane 
and they looked like they tried 
    and then  after that   he was trying to get the plane 
but he did not 
  so the elephant did not know what to do 
and the giraffe was crying 
and the elephant decided I ll have an idea 
and the elephant went to get a net 
and then  he used it to get the plane  and got the plane for the giraffe 
the end  
oops  and the giraffe was really happy 
the end  
there was a rabbit and a dog 
they were  making a sandcastle 
and then the dog and the rabbit made the sandcastle 
and the dog was sitting into the sandbox and said hey rabbit we made it 
we made it 
  and the  rabbit was helping the dog make it more bigger 
  and he put too much on  and made it fall right down on it 
and then it   almost   then it broke 
and then it was totally broken   by the end 
the end  
   there once was a dog and a rabbit 
they wanted to go on a   picnic instead of making a sandcastle in the park 
rabbit wanted to have the most stuff 
so he took out   all of his stuff and  started his stuff 
and the dog  wanted to eat just this couple of stuff 
and the rabbit was totally full 
and   he was almost  having a tummyache 
and then he fell down 
and he had a big tummyache 
and the dog ran to get his mom   to help 
and then  the dog begged his mom to  do it 
so the mom came  and helped 
and he was okay 
the end  
instead of going   for a picnic   and going into the park and making a sandcastle  they got a balloon 
and they were playing with  a balloon 
and they tied it onto their  wagon 
they were driving it around 
and the rabbit wanted to take it off 
and the rabbit was trying to take it off 
and then he made it fly away 
and the rabbit did not know what to do 
and the dog was very mad 
and then      the dog was still mad 
and the rabbit was going to  get another one for  the  dog 
and the balloons were five cents 
and he could not get it because he did not have any money 
and the dog   wanted to get one too 
and he tried to get  one 
and  the dog was waiting for the rabbit to get some money from its mom 
and it asked the mom  if he could have some money to buy the balloon 
and he got five cents and got a balloon  for the kids 
and they gotta play all they want with the balloons 
the end
