there is a girl    elephant goes swimming 
the ball falls into the water 
  the  horse swims after it 
he passes the ball up  to the girl elephant 
the  horse  is all wet 
the elephant and the horse are looking at the water 
the girl  elephant starts to walk towards it 
she  runs away 
she   fell down and hurts her knee 
     the horse and another  elephant came along 
and they put a bandaid  on her knee 
and  they help her  walk 
then  she sits on the bench 
the girl is looking  at  the horse and the water 
the horse     is flying a plane 
the girl  takes it  and  starts flying it 
and then it falls into the water 
it sinks down to water 
and the horse gets mad 
and then  it sinks deeper and deeper into the water 
then she says sorry  to the  elephant 
  then he jumps in and gets it 
and then  the horse  is crying 
then  a girl came along and had a net with her 
and  she holded it by the water 
she took  it out 
then  the horse was happy again 
then he said thank you 
the rabbit is playing in the sandbox 
and then a boy comes along 
they play together  and have fun 
then the rabbit pours sand all over her castle 
then it breaks 
and he  says sorry 
then the girl starts crying 
the girl meets a boy 
they are both going to  have a picnic 
they have a picnic together 
then    when they are both done eating     the boy bunny  gets  full 
then  he says he has a stomachache 
then a doctor comes along 
then  the girl pulls him   towards the boy bunny 
then the doctor talks to him 
then he is all better 
  the girl comes   along with her wagon with a balloon 
and    the boy rabbit comes along 
then  he says I want that balloon 
then he holds it 
then  he lets it go  
and   they start running after it 
then the girl comes back 
and then   a guy came along with more balloons 
then the boy says can I have one of those balloons 
and let him have one 
but he did not have no money 
so then the girl  was sad 
then the boy rabbit    walked away 
so did the girl 
she ran 
    and then the boy rabbit told  the doctor that she was sad 
then the doctor pays  for the balloons 
then they both  have a balloon 
and then they are happy
